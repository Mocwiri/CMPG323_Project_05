So far what one can get from this visual is that you have all the data in the high level metric page
That can make a change in the business, And you have pages for Customers, Products and orders.

# Customers
What you will be able to understand from customer page is that you will get table showing you total orders made by the customers in our database
Another thing you can get in table with all the customers together with their order ID.
Then we habe all those orders sorted month by month from all the customers we have.

# Order
Then in Order page you dont have much is just all the orders sorted by customers, meaning we grouped/counted the orders a customer made.
From then on we grouped all the orders by months so you can see how many order per month.

# Products
So under products we have quiet alot of things like tables for all the categories or items in our category column
Another thing is that we have a pie chart with all the products sorted by categories 
And Numbers of units per category to let the user know how many do we have for each item in our category
